I am new to learning Python and have zero prior experience, I'm just using sites and online tutorials to self teach on how to code such as Codecademy, Google, Coursera, Copiliot, & Youtube. 
There is a long way for me to improve, and to analyse and read and not all the bugs are documented as I forget all of them I just noted the one's that I could recall or caused genuine issue.
